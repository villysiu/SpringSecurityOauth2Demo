Given a well-formed JWT, Resource Server will:

Validate its signature against a public key obtained from the jwks_url endpoint during startup and matched against the JWT

Validate the JWT’s exp and nbf timestamps and the JWT’s iss claim, and

Map each scope to an authority with the prefix SCOPE_.

The resulting Authentication#getPrincipal, by default, is a Spring Security Jwt object, and Authentication#getName maps to the JWT’s sub property, if one is present.
